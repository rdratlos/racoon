+
+History
+=======
+
+Ipsec-tools was originally developed by the KAME project. It was then moved
+on SourfeForge, at the following address:
 
-Sources can be found at the IPsec-Tools home page at:
 	http://ipsec-tools.sourceforge.net/
 
-And CVS repository is hosted at NetBSD tree:
-	cvs -danoncvs@anoncvs.netbsd.org:/cvsroot co ipsec-tools
+Due to too restricted commit accesses, the development stalled, and the
+source code was moved into NetBSD's CVS repository, in:
+
+	src/crypto/dist/ipsec-tools
+
+However, many distributions still take their tarballs from SourceForge, and
+each distribution maintains local patches.
+
+FreeBSD maintains its own libipsec and setkey tools, in:
+
+	head/lib/libipsec/
+	head/sbin/setkey/
+
+A Trac used to exist, at the following address:
 
-Bug reports and project wiki is located at:
 	https://trac.ipsec-tools.net/
 
-Please report any problems to the mailing list:
+but the domain expired and was not renewed.
+
+The mailing lists from SourceForge still exist:
+
 	ipsec-tools-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
 	ipsec-tools-users@lists.sourceforge.net
