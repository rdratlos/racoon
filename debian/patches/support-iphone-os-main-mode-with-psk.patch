Subject: support-iphone-os-main-mode-with-psk

The iPhone OS has a strange set of VPN features.  Using L2TP over IPsec
it only supports main mode with pre-shared keys (no certificates). 
Since L2TP provides the per-user authentication we want to use a single 
pre-shared key for all VPN users, but this is hard to do with 
ipsec-tools since racoon only supports pskey lookup by address when 
identity protection is used and we do not know the address of the client 
in advance.  The attached patch adds a wildcard match to the psk.txt 
reading code, specifying an id of * will match any client.
